# About this Project (Smart contract repository in Solidity)
PlatziPunks is a marketplace of NFTs created from data stored entirely on the blockchain and displayed through an application hosted on a decentralized file system.

Platzi Punks is a collection of randomized Avatars whose metadata is stored on-chain. They have unique characteristics and there are only 10000 in existence.

Each Platzi Punk is generated sequentially based on your address, use the previewer to find out what your Platzi Punk would be if you lie right now.

This project is inspired by OpenSea (https://opensea.io/es) and realized in a course on the Platzi platform (https://platzi.com/)

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
